## 💼 My Career Journey
I’ve had the privilege to work on exciting projects and grow my expertise through different roles:

- **PeopleWeek**: Gained my first backend development experience, working on HR Management software for banks using React.js and PHP/Symfony.
- **Piksel**: Contributed to projects like TheLocal, maintaining WordPress sites and developing applications with Laravel and React Native.

These experiences allowed me to work with a variety of tools, frameworks, and platforms beyond what I use daily.
